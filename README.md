# To-Do List Flask Web App

A minimalistic and user-friendly to-do list application built with Flask, allowing users to organize and manage their tasks efficiently.

## Features
- Add tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks when no longer needed.
- Change password.
- Delete account.
- Simple and responsive user interface.

## Motivation
I created this web application as my final project for CS50 (An online introduction to computer science course). 
I wanted to make a web application to further develop my Python and Flask skills as well as my developer skills in general.
Giving users the ability to create accounts and store tasks in a database were features that I knew I wanted to implement.
This gave me good practice in interacting with a database to create, read, update, and delete data.
